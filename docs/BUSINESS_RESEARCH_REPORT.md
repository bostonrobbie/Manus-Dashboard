## Part 1: Google Ads ROI Analysis

### Industry Benchmarks

The trading and fintech sectors face some of the highest advertising costs in digital marketing. According to WordStream's research, "Trading" ranks as the **#12 most expensive keyword category** in Google Ads with an average cost per click of $33.19 [1].

| Industry Benchmark          | Value        | Source              |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Trading keyword CPC         | $33.19       | WordStream          |
| Fintech conversion rate     | 1.23% - 2.8% | Lever Digital       |
| SaaS conversion rate        | 1.89% - 4.7% | AdLabz              |
| Fintech cost per conversion | $1,738       | Firebrand Marketing |
| Average Google Ads ROI      | 200%         | Google              |
| Pipeline ROI (B2B)          | 8.17x        | HockeyStack         |

### $100 Budget Projection

With a $100 advertising budget targeting trading-related keywords, the expected outcomes are:

**Conservative Scenario (High-competition keywords):**

- Expected clicks: 3 (at $33.19 CPC)
- Expected conversions: 0.05 (essentially zero)
- Verdict: **Not recommended**

**Optimistic Scenario (Long-tail keywords at $6.50 CPC):**

- Expected clicks: 15
- Expected conversions: 0-1
- Verdict: **Insufficient for meaningful data**

The consensus from PPC experts on Reddit's r/SaaS community is clear: budgets under $500 are "more like fishing than running a paid media campaign" [2]. One experienced marketer noted that "the first part of the campaign is collecting the right data, and if you don't have the right budget, it will take ages" [2].

### $1,000 Budget Projection

A $1,000 budget provides more actionable results, though still limited:

| Scenario     | CPC | Clicks | Conv. Rate | Conversions | CPA    |
| ------------ | --- | ------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Conservative | $15 | 67     | 1.5%       | 1           | $1,000 |
| Moderate     | $8  | 125    | 3%         | 3-4         | $267   |
| Optimistic   | $5  | 200    | 5%         | 10          | $100   |

**Revenue Impact Analysis (at $29/month subscription):**

| Scenario     | Conversions | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue | 12-Month ROI |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Conservative | 1           | $29             | $348           | -65%         |
| Moderate     | 4           | $116            | $1,392         | +39%         |
| Optimistic   | 10          | $290            | $3,480         | +248%        |

### Real-World Case Study

A SaaS founder shared results from a $60/week Google Ads campaign for a developer tool [2]:

> "Budget: ~$60 total over 7 days. Results: 7,074 impressions, 133 clicks, 14 conversions (new signups). Revenue from ads: $0."

This illustrates a common pattern: low-budget campaigns can drive signups but rarely generate immediate revenue, especially for products with free tiers.

### Recommendation

**For $100 budget:** Do not use Google Ads. Instead, invest time in organic channels.

**For $1,000 budget:** Proceed with caution. Use long-tail keywords, set up proper conversion tracking, and expect 2-5 conversions realistically. Focus on lifetime value rather than immediate ROI.

**Minimum recommended budget for sustainable growth:** $2,000-3,000/month
