## Production Notes

### Visual Style Guidelines

The video should maintain a consistent dark theme with emerald green (#10b981) and blue (#3b82f6) accent colors. All transitions should be smooth and professional, avoiding jarring cuts. Text overlays should use a clean sans-serif font (Inter or similar) with subtle animations.

### Key Selling Points to Emphasize

Throughout the video, the following value propositions should be visually reinforced: the 15+ years of backtested data providing credibility, the included brokerage connector saving users money, the real-time signal delivery ensuring timely execution, and the professional-grade analytics typically reserved for institutional traders.

### Pacing Recommendations

The first 30 seconds should hook viewers with impressive statistics and clean visuals. The middle section (30-90 seconds) demonstrates features without overwhelming. The final 30 seconds drives home the value proposition and call-to-action.

### Music Suggestions

Consider tracks similar to those used in Manus product updates: modern electronic with subtle builds, clean beats, and an optimistic tone. The music should enhance the visuals without distracting from the content.
