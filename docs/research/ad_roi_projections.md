## Scenario 1: $100 Ad Budget

### Conservative Estimate (High-competition keywords like "trading")

| Metric               | Calculation      | Result                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Budget               | -                | $100                     |
| Average CPC          | Trading keywords | $33.19                   |
| Expected Clicks      | $100 ÷ $33.19    | **3 clicks**             |
| Conversion Rate      | Fintech average  | 1.5%                     |
| Expected Conversions | 3 × 1.5%         | **0.05 (essentially 0)** |

**Verdict:** $100 is insufficient for competitive trading keywords. You would get approximately 3 clicks with near-zero chance of conversion.

### Optimistic Estimate (Long-tail keywords)

| Metric               | Calculation            | Result                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Budget               | -                      | $100                  |
| Average CPC          | Long-tail keywords     | $5-8                  |
| Expected Clicks      | $100 ÷ $6.50           | **15 clicks**         |
| Conversion Rate      | Optimized landing page | 3%                    |
| Expected Conversions | 15 × 3%                | **0.45 (likely 0-1)** |

**Verdict:** With long-tail keywords, you might get 1 signup, but $100 is still too small for meaningful data.

## Scenario 2: $1,000 Ad Budget

### Conservative Estimate (Mixed keyword strategy)

| Metric               | Calculation     | Result           |

| Average CPC          | Blended         | $15              |
| Expected Clicks      | $1,000 ÷ $15    | **67 clicks**    |
| Conversion Rate      | Fintech average | 1.5%             |
| Expected Conversions | 67 × 1.5%       | **1 conversion** |
| Cost Per Acquisition | $1,000 ÷ 1      | **$1,000**       |

### Moderate Estimate (Optimized campaign)

| Metric               | Calculation       | Result              |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Budget               | -                 | $1,000              |
| Average CPC          | Long-tail focused | $8                  |
| Expected Clicks      | $1,000 ÷ $8       | **125 clicks**      |
| Conversion Rate      | Well-optimized    | 3%                  |
| Expected Conversions | 125 × 3%          | **3-4 conversions** |
| Cost Per Acquisition | $1,000 ÷ 3.75     | **$267**            |

### Optimistic Estimate (Highly targeted campaign)

| Metric               | Calculation         | Result             |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Budget               | -                   | $1,000             |
| Average CPC          | Niche long-tail     | $5                 |
| Expected Clicks      | $1,000 ÷ $5         | **200 clicks**     |
| Conversion Rate      | Excellent targeting | 5%                 |
| Expected Conversions | 200 × 5%            | **10 conversions** |
| Cost Per Acquisition | $1,000 ÷ 10         | **$100**           |

## Real-World Case Study Data

From Reddit r/SaaS community (actual results):

**Case 1: CaptureKit (Developer API)**

- Budget: $60 over 7 days
- Results: 7,074 impressions, 133 clicks, 14 signups
- CPC: ~$0.45 (very low for dev tools)
- Conversion Rate: 10.5% (unusually high)
- Revenue: $0 (free tier users)

**Case 2: Anonymous SaaS**

- Budget: $200 over 1 month
- Results: Less than 10 users
- CPC: ~$20+
- Very poor results

**Key Insight:** Low budgets ($60-200) are essentially "fishing" - not enough data to optimize. Experts recommend minimum $1,000-2,500/month for meaningful campaigns.

## Recommended Keyword Strategy

### High-Intent Keywords (Higher CPC, Better Conversion)

- "trading performance dashboard"
- "track trading strategies"
- "futures trading analytics"
- "TradingView performance tracking"

### Long-Tail Keywords (Lower CPC, Moderate Volume)

- "how to track intraday trading performance"
- "best way to analyze trading strategies"
- "futures trading journal software"
- "compare trading strategy returns"

### Negative Keywords (Exclude to save budget)

- "free"
- "download"
- "course"
- "learn"
- "tutorial"
- "beginner"

## Recommendations

### For $100 Budget

**Do NOT use Google Ads.** Instead:

1. Focus on SEO and content marketing
2. Engage in trading communities (Reddit, Discord)
3. Create YouTube content showing the dashboard
4. Partner with trading educators/influencers

### For $1,000 Budget

**Proceed with caution:**

1. Start with $500 for testing (2-3 weeks)
2. Use long-tail keywords only
3. Set up proper conversion tracking
4. Create dedicated landing page
5. A/B test ad copy
6. Expect 2-5 conversions realistically
7. Focus on lifetime value, not immediate ROI

### Minimum Recommended Budget

For sustainable Google Ads growth: **$2,000-3,000/month**

- Allows proper A/B testing
- Sufficient data for optimization
- Can target multiple keyword groups
- Expected results: 10-30 conversions/month

## Alternative Marketing Channels (Better ROI for Early Stage)

| Channel             | Cost          | Expected Results            | Time Investment |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| SEO/Content         | $0-500        | Long-term compound growth   | High            |
| Reddit/Communities  | $0            | 5-20 signups/month          | Medium          |
| YouTube             | $0-200        | 10-50 signups/month         | High            |
| Twitter/X           | $0            | 5-15 signups/month          | Medium          |
| Product Hunt        | $0            | 50-500 signups (launch day) | Low             |
| Affiliate Program   | Revenue share | Scalable                    | Low             |
| Trading Influencers | $200-1000     | 20-100 signups              | Low             |

## Conclusion

For a trading analytics dashboard at early stage:

1. **$100 Google Ads = Not recommended** - Insufficient for any meaningful results
2. **$1,000 Google Ads = Marginal** - Expect 2-5 conversions, break-even at best
3. **Better alternatives exist** - Community engagement, content marketing, and influencer partnerships offer better ROI for early-stage SaaS

The 200% average Google Ads ROI applies to mature campaigns with optimized targeting, not new campaigns with small budgets.
