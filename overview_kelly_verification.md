# Overview Page Kelly Equity Curve Verification - December 17, 2025

## Kelly Equity Curve Feature ✓
The Kelly equity curve toggle is now visible in the chart legend showing "Kelly (4.8%)". This represents the half-Kelly optimal position sizing based on the calculated Kelly criterion from trade statistics.

The legend shows three toggleable lines:
1. Portfolio (main equity curve)
2. S&P 500 (benchmark)
3. Kelly (4.8%) - optimal position sizing curve

The Kelly percentage (4.8%) is calculated from the win rate and average win/loss ratio, then halved for safety (half-Kelly approach).
