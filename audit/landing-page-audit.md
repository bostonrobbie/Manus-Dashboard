## Conversion Optimization Opportunities

### High Priority (Quick Wins)
1. **Add free trial CTA** - "Start 7-Day Free Trial" instead of just login
2. **Add testimonials** - Even 2-3 quotes would help
3. **Annual pricing discount** - Offer $40/month billed annually
4. **Live chat widget** - Intercom or similar
5. **Exit intent popup** - Capture emails with lead magnet

### Medium Priority
1. **Video demo** - 2-minute platform walkthrough
2. **Comparison table** - vs Collective2, SignalStack
3. **Case study** - "How John made $X using our strategies"
4. **Social proof numbers** - "Join 500+ traders"
5. **Trust badges** - SSL, Stripe verified, etc.

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Blog/Education section** - SEO value
2. **Interactive calculator** - "See your potential returns"
