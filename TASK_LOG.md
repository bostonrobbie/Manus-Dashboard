## Completed Tasks

### ✅ [CODEX] Quality-first logging & monitoring pass (Mar 2026)
**Completed:** March 2026

**What Was Done:**
- Added centralized tRPC error-handling middleware with structured logs and monitoring hooks.
- Hardened TradingView webhook error handling and audit logging.
- Added chart rendering optimizations (memoization + downsampling) and database indexes for trade/equity queries.
- Updated documentation (README, API contract, task log) to reflect current system behavior and health checks.

**Follow-ups:**
- Connect monitoring abstraction to a real provider when credentials become available.
- Replace naive downsampling with smarter algorithms if datasets grow further.

### ✅ [MANUS] Repository Analysis (Dec 4, 2025)
**Completed:** December 4, 2025 10:00 AM EST
**Duration:** 10 minutes

**What Was Done:**
- Cloned GitHub repository from https://github.com/bostonrobbie/Manus-Dashboard
- Analyzed project structure (monorepo with pnpm workspaces)
- Reviewed existing database schema (comprehensive, MySQL-based)
- Examined existing API endpoints (tRPC-based)
- Identified existing features (portfolio overview, trade ingestion, benchmarks)
- Documented gaps (individual strategy page, comparison page, etc.)

**Key Findings:**
- Codebase is well-structured and modern
- Already has testing infrastructure (Vitest, Playwright)
- Database schema is comprehensive and includes webhook logging
- Portfolio engine exists with analytics capabilities
- Missing: Strategy comparison, individual strategy pages, enhanced UI

---

### ✅ [MANUS] Comprehensive Project Plan Created (Dec 4, 2025)
**Completed:** December 4, 2025 10:15 AM EST

- Context sync and baseline validation (Dec 4, 2025) – baseline commands executed, docs reviewed
**Duration:** 15 minutes  

**What Was Done:**
- Created detailed 7-phase implementation roadmap
- Documented all technical requirements
- Designed API contracts for new endpoints
- Outlined testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Created quality assurance plan
- Documented risk mitigation strategies
- Defined success metrics

**Deliverable:** `/home/ubuntu/COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_PLAN.md`

---

### ✅ [CODEX] Portfolio Analytics Endpoints (Dec 4, 2025)
**Completed:** December 4, 2025

**What Was Done:**
- Implemented contract-compliant `portfolio.overview` with benchmark comparison, drawdowns, and breakdowns.
- Added new `strategyDetail` endpoint with metrics, drawdowns, recent trades, and breakdowns.
- Added `compareStrategies` endpoint with forward-filled curves, equal-weight combined equity, and correlation matrix.
- Updated API contract status flags and added Vitest coverage for the new endpoints.

**Notes/Follow-ups:**
- Regime analysis and advanced risk metrics (VaR/CVaR/Omega) remain pending for future iterations.

---

### ✅ [CODEX] TradingView Webhook & CSV Seeds (Feb 4, 2026)
**Completed:** February 4, 2026

**What Was Done:**
- Implemented `POST /api/webhook/tradingview` with secret validation, payload normalization, trade insertion, and webhook logging.
- Added webhook integration tests covering success, invalid secret, and malformed payload paths.
- Created CSV seed scripts for strategies, trades, and SPY benchmark data with an orchestrated `seed:all` entry point.
- Documented webhook usage and seed commands in `README.md`.

**Assumptions:**
- Webhook requests must include entry/exit prices and timestamps to persist complete trade rows.
- Seeds and webhooks default to `userId=1` (overridable via `SEED_USER_ID` or `TRADINGVIEW_WEBHOOK_USER_ID`).

**Follow-ups:**
- Add rate limiting and retry/backoff handling for webhook calls.
- Consider supporting open/close events without full entry/exit data in future schema updates.

---

### ✅ [CODEX] Portfolio UI Enhancements (Feb 5, 2026)
**Completed:** February 5, 2026

**What Was Done:**
- Rebuilt the portfolio overview page with contract-compliant time ranges, starting capital control, equity/drawdown charts, KPI grid, and breakdowns.
- Added new Strategy Detail and Strategy Comparison pages with reusable components (charts, metrics grid, multi-select, correlation heatmap).
- Introduced unit tests for the three pages and Playwright flows covering overview toggles, strategy detail render, and comparison selection.
- Documented navigation updates in README and refreshed UI widgets (time range selector, starting capital input).

**Next Steps:**
- Expand UX polish for edge cases (empty states, data sparsity) and add more robust data-driven E2E assertions once fixtures are available.

---

### ✅ [CODEX] Testing Infrastructure Hardening (Dec 4, 2025)
**Completed:** December 4, 2025

**What Was Done:**
- Added Vitest unit coverage for core metric helpers (returns, drawdowns, forward-fill, correlation, combined equity) and integration checks for portfolio overview/strategy detail/compare strategies plus webhook secret handling.
- Expanded front-end page tests for Overview, Strategy Detail, and Strategy Comparison to cover loading/error states, control-driven query params, and chart/testid hooks for E2E stability.
- Updated Playwright smoke flows for overview toggles, strategy detail controls, and comparison correlation visibility.
- Enabled workspace-wide coverage commands (`pnpm test:coverage`).

**Coverage Snapshot:**
- Backend core metrics modules: `server/core/portfolioMetrics.ts` ~91% lines; `server/engine/metrics.ts` ~82% lines. Overall server coverage ~12% due to untested admin/ingestion routes and scripts.
- Frontend pages: Overview ~92% lines, Strategy Comparison ~99%, Strategy Detail ~99%. Overall client coverage ~23% with many auxiliary pages/components still untested.

**Intentionally Untested / Pending:**
- Admin/workspace routers, ingestion pipelines, and health checks require database-backed fixtures.
- Legacy Node test suite still fails without Manus-specific env/config; left untouched to avoid regressions.
- Playwright run requires a live preview server; current command fails in headless CI without the app running.

## Questions for Human (Rob)

### Q1: Strategy Weighting in Comparison
**Asked:** December 4, 2025  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Context:** When combining multiple strategies into a portfolio on the comparison page, should we:
- Option A: Use equal weighting (e.g., 3 strategies = 33.3% each)
- Option B: Allow custom weighting (user can specify percentages)
- Option C: Use capital-based weighting (based on actual capital allocated)

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A (equal weighting) for simplicity, add Option B in v2.

**Answer:** _Pending_

---

### Q2: Real-Time Data Updates
**Asked:** December 4, 2025  
**Priority:** Low  
**Context:** Should the dashboard update in real-time when new trades come in via webhooks, or is it acceptable to require a page refresh?

**Recommendation:** Page refresh is fine for v1, real-time updates can be added later with WebSockets.

**Answer:** _Pending_

---

### Q3: Historical Data Requirements
**Asked:** December 4, 2025  
**Priority:** High  
**Context:** Do you have historical trade data for your 8 intraday strategies that we can use for:
1. Seeding the database for development/testing
2. Calculating historical performance metrics
3. Generating equity curves

If yes, in what format? (CSV, JSON, etc.)

**Answer:** _Pending_

---

## Collaboration Tips for AIs

### When Working on Backend
1. Always write unit tests first (TDD approach)
2. Update TypeScript types in `shared/types/`
3. Document endpoint in API_CONTRACT.md
4. Use structured logging for all operations
5. Handle errors gracefully with try-catch

### When Working on Frontend
1. Use tRPC hooks for data fetching
2. Implement loading and error states
3. Ensure mobile responsiveness
4. Use TailwindCSS for styling
5. Test on multiple screen sizes

### When Writing Tests
1. Use descriptive test names
2. Test edge cases and error conditions
3. Mock external dependencies
4. Keep tests fast (< 1 second each)
5. Ensure tests are deterministic

### When Documenting
1. Use clear, concise language
2. Include code examples
3. Document "why" not just "what"
4. Keep documentation close to code
5. Update docs when code changes
