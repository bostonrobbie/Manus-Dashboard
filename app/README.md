# Legacy Manus dashboard (app/)

This package contains the deprecated Manus dashboard that predated the current `client/` frontend. It remains in the repository only for historical reference and should not be part of normal builds, deployments, or tests. The supported frontend for Manus deployments lives in `client/`.

If you intentionally need to experiment with the legacy UI, install dependencies locally and run scripts from within this directory. Otherwise, prefer the modern `client/` dashboard.
