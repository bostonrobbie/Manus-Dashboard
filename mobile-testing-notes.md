# Mobile Responsiveness Testing Notes

## Date: Dec 20, 2025

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Strategies page** - Chart now loads properly, legend is visible
2. **Overview page** - Time range buttons wrap properly on mobile
3. **DashboardLayout** - Reduced padding on mobile (p-3 instead of p-6)
4. **StrategyDetail page** - Charts have negative margin on mobile for better fit

### Remaining Observations:
- The chart on Strategies page is now loading and displaying all 8 strategies
- Legend items are visible and properly formatted
- Strategy cards are displayed in a grid layout

### Screenshot Evidence:
- Desktop view shows chart loading correctly with all strategy lines
- Individual strategy cards are visible below the chart
