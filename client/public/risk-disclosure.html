        <h1>Risk Disclosure Statement</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: December 31, 2025</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING</h3>
            <p><strong>Trading futures and other derivatives involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors.</strong> You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate for you in light of your financial condition. You may lose all or more than your initial investment.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. General Risk Warning</h2>
        <p>STS Systematic Trading Strategies ("STS Futures," "we," "us," or "our") provides trading signals, analytics, and educational information related to futures trading. The information provided on our platform is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other type of advice.</p>
        <p>Past performance is not indicative of future results. Any historical returns, expected returns, or probability projections may not reflect actual future performance. All investments involve risk, and the past performance of a security, industry, sector, market, financial product, trading strategy, or individual's trading does not guarantee future results or returns.</p>

        <h2>2. Futures Trading Risks</h2>
        <p>Futures trading carries specific risks that you should understand before engaging in such activities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Leverage Risk:</strong> Futures contracts are highly leveraged instruments. A relatively small market movement can have a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited. This can work against you as well as for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> Futures markets can be extremely volatile. Prices can change rapidly and unpredictably, potentially resulting in significant losses.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin Calls:</strong> You may be required to deposit additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. If you fail to meet a margin call, your position may be liquidated at a loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li><strong>Gap Risk:</strong> Markets can gap significantly between trading sessions, potentially resulting in losses that exceed your stop-loss orders.</li>
            <li><strong>System Risk:</strong> Electronic trading systems are subject to failures, delays, and errors that could result in missed trades or incorrect executions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. No Investment Advice</h2>
        <p>STS Futures does not provide personalized investment advice. The trading signals, strategies, and analytics provided on our platform are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Based on historical data and backtesting, which may not reflect future market conditions</li>
            <li>Not tailored to your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, or investment objectives</li>
            <li>Not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold any specific futures contract or security</li>
            <li>For informational and educational purposes only</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="cftc-box">
            <h3>CFTC RULE 4.41 - HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE</h3>
            <p>HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS.</p>
        </div>
