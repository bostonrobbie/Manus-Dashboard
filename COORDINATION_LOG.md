# Coordination Log

## 2025-12-14
- Documented current backup state and gaps in `docs/SYNC_PLAN.md` to guide Manus-native parity work.
- Added `FEATURE_MANIFEST.md` to track backend/frontend/doc readiness and highlight missing risk-of-ruin and config alignment tasks.
- Noted DB env mismatch (Postgres URL vs MySQL Drizzle config) for early correction before deeper sync tasks.
