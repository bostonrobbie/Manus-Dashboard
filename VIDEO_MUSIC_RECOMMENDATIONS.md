## Music Editing Notes

If the track isn't exactly 110 BPM:

1. **Time-stretch** the audio in your DAW (±10% is usually unnoticeable)
2. **Cut on downbeats** to maintain rhythm
3. **Use the track's natural build** for Scene 7 intensity increase

### Beat Mapping Process:

1. Import track into audio editor (Audition, Logic, etc.)
2. Enable BPM detection or tap tempo
3. Mark beat 1 of each measure
4. Export beat markers as timecode
5. Align video cuts to markers in Premiere/DaVinci
